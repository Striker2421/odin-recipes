    <p> Masterful work of ravioli

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil: I like to use olive oil, but any fairly neutral oil will work.</li>
        <li>Onion: The onion adds a lot of flavor, so I wouldn't skip it. You can dice the onion really finely if you don't want big chunks.</li>
        <li>Garlic: This is also to add flavor. You could use garlic powder, but fresh garlic really will make the biggest impact.</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper: It's always important to season!</li>
        <li>Tomatoes: You'll need both canned whole tomatoes and crushed fire-roasted tomatoes. The fire roasted tomatoes add a delicious smoky flavor. You'll use these to make an easy homemade marinara sauce.</li>
        <li>Herbs: I use dried oregano and dried thyme.</li>
        <li>Ravioli: I have only tested this recipe using frozen ravioli. You could probably use the ravioli you can find in the refrigerated section at the grocery store. I always use cheese ravioli, but I think any filled ravioli would work just fine.</li>
        <li>Cheese: I like a mixture of mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Start by making the sauce. Using a large skillet over medium heat, heat up some olive oil and add a medium chopped onion. Cook this, stirring as needed, until the onion is soft and turning translucent.</li>
        <li>When the onion is tender, add the garlic and cook just until fragrant, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Next add your tomatoes. You’ll need one large can (28 oz) of whole tomatoes plus another large can of crushed, fire-roasted tomatoes. You’ll add the liquid as well – no need to drain the tomatoes. I love the chunkiness of the sauce from using the whole tomatoes, but if you don’t want a lot of chunks, feel free to use 2 cans of crushed tomatoes.Also – you can use regular crushed tomatoes instead of the fire-roasted tomatoes, but I actually really love the smokiness that comes from the fire-roasted tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Add in your dried herbs and stir the sauce. Let it come to a boil, then reduce the heat and allow it to cook until it has thickened and reduced. You will need to stir it every once in awhile. This will take about 20 to 25 minutes. When it’s done, taste it and add more salt and pepper, if needed.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is cooking, cook your ravioli. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add your pasta, and cook according to the package directions. This usually only takes a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta and return it to the pot, then add the finished pasta sauce and gently stir to combine. You don’t want to break the ravioli open, so be gentle.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into a baking dish that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Top it with lots of shredded mozzarella and parmesan, then bake it until the cheese is melted and everything is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Let the pasta sit for a few minutes before serving it. Top it with chopped parsley or basil, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
